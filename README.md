# SeamZo
The recognition and
interest shown from industry giants, influencers, and investors have made many people trust the
new shift to the decentralized world. That is causing new concepts and trends like NFTs to
thrive. We have targeted such a group of creators and collectors interested in sharing their
collections and profiting from their efforts. "A trusted social platform and a marketplace for
digital assets in one app called SeamZo that will live on the blockchain and use NFTs for
digital ownership" is what came to us after much thinking.
Internet, data, trust, and security together were never in demand before as they are today. We are
aiming to achieve this in SeamZo by securing all the valuable data through blockchain

1. Allow users to purchase and sell nfts.

2. Allow digital artists to post any form of digital content and mint NFTs
against them.
3. NFTs provide a certificate of ownership so no one else can take credit for
it. People can copy and produce it but there is only the owner i.e you.
